# Welcome to my 2024 study roadmap repository!

Welcome to my 2024 study roadmap repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive plan for my personal studies in 2024. It includes a diverse range of topics and resources that I will utilize to expand my knowledge and skills throughout the year.

I will frequently update this repository with my progress and any modifications made to the plan. My intention is for this roadmap to be a valuable resource for others who are seeking guidance in planning their own studies and maximizing their learning potential. 
Feel free to explore the roadmap and draw inspiration for your own educational journey.

Thank you for visiting!
